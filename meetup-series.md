# Offline Meetup Schedule [Timing : 10 am - 6 pm]
|Meetup  | Title      | Date | Description|
|--------|------------|------------|------------|
|1| **Intro to Data Science** | 23rd November, 2019 | Applications of Data Science, Tools and Flow |
|2| **Gradient Descent and related algorithms.** | 14th December, 2019 | Using the assignments that we have provided in Meetup 1, we have to explain gradient descent, and possibly the other such algorithms. The assignment for this meetup will be considering a loss function and randomly initiated the weights and plotting the loss using python.|
|3| **Regression Techniques.** | 21st December, 2019 | We'll include Linear and Logistic Regression in this session.|
|4| **Tree-based and Bagging Algorithms.** | 5th January, 2020 | Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc|
|5| **Boosting Techniques.** | 19th January, 2020 | XGBoost, LightGBM, etc|
|6| **Intro to Neural Nets.** | 2nd February, 2020 | We'll start from linear and logistic regression and complicate it a little to explain Deep Neural Nets. If possible we can explain CNNs and RNNs as well.|
